# Project Overview

Remote Procedure Call (RPC) is a crucial technology in distributed computing that enables software applications to communicate with each other seamlessly over a network. It provides a way for a client to call a function on a remote server as if it were a local function call. This abstraction allows developers to build distributed systems and applications that span multiple machines and platforms.

This project is a custom RPC system that allows computations to be split seamlessly between multiple computers. This system may differ from standard RPC systems, but the underlying principles of RPC will still apply.

# RPC System Architecture

The RPC system is implemented in two files, called rpc.c and rpc.h. The resulting system can be linked to either a client or a server.

# API

The basic API implemented by rpc.c consists of the following data structures and functions.

## Data structures

The API will send and receive data structures of the form:

```c
typedef struct {
int data1;
size_t data2_len;
void *data2;
} rpc_data;
```

where `data1` is an integer to be passed to the other side, and `data2` is a block of bytes (of length data2_len) to be sent. The purpose of `data1` is to allow simple functions that only pass an integer to avoid memory management issues, by setting `data2_len=0` and `data2=NULL`. Your protocol can limit `data1` to being no more than 64 bits.

Note that `size_t` depends on the architecture, and the sender and receiver can have different architectures.

The handler that implements the actual remote procedure will have the signature:

```c
rpc_data *procedure (rpc_data *d);
```

That is, it takes a pointer to an `rpc_data` object and returns a pointer to another `rpc_data` object. This function will dynamically allocate memory with malloc for both the `rpc_data` structure and its `data2` field. It is the responsibility of the RPC system to free those after use.

The state of the client and server are declared in rpc.h as:

```c
typedef struct rpc_client rpc_client;
typedef struct rpc_server rpc_server;
```

The actual struct definitions are in rpc.c. These are returned by initialization functions `rpc_init_client` and `rpc_init_server`, and passed to all other functions.

## Server-side API

```c
rpc_server *rpc_init_server (int port)
```

Called before `rpc_register`. It returns a pointer to a struct containing server state information on success and `NULL` on failure.

```c
int rpc_register (rpc_server *srv, const char *name, rpc_data* (*handler)(rpc_data*))
```

At the server, let the subsystem know what function to call when an incoming request is received.

It should return a non-negative number on success, and -1 on failure. If any of the arguments is NULL then -1 should be returned.

If there is already a function registered with name name, then the old function should be forgotten and the new
one should take its place.

```c
void rpc_serve_all (rpc_server *srv)
```

This function will wait for incoming requests for any of the registered functions, or `rpc_find`, on the port specified in `rpc_init_server` of any interface. If it is a function call request, it will call the requested function, send a reply to the caller, and resume waiting for new requests. If it is `rpc_find`, it will reply to the caller saying whether the name was found or not, or possibly an error code.

This function will not usually return.

It should only return if `srv` is `NULL` or youâ€™re handling SIGINT.

## Client-side API

```c
rpc_client *rpc_init_client (const char *addr, int port)
```

Called before `rpc_find` or `rpc_call`. The string addr and integer port are the text-based IP address and numeric port number passed in on the command line.

The function should return a non-NULL pointer to a struct (that you define) containing client state information on success and `NULL` on failure.

```c
void rpc_close_client (rpc_client *cl)
```

Called after the final `rpc_call` or `rpc_find` (i.e., any use of the RPC system by the client).

If it is (mistakenly) called on a client that has already been closed, or `cl == NULL`, it should return without error.

```c
rpc_handle *rpc_find (rpc_client *cl, const char *name)
```

At the client, tell the subsystem what details are required to place a call. The return value is a handle (not handler) for the remote procedure, which is passed to the following function.

If name is not registered, it should return `NULL`. If any of the arguments are `NULL` then `NULL` should be returned. If the find operation fails, it returns `NULL`.

```c
rpc_data *rpc_call (rpc_client *cl, rpc_handle *h, const rpc_data *data)
```

This function causes the subsystem to run the remote procedure, and returns the value.

If the call fails, it returns `NULL`. `NULL` should be returned if any of the arguments are `NULL`. If this returns a non-NULL value, then it should dynamically allocate (by malloc) both the `rpc_data` structure and its `data2` field. The client will free these by `rpc_data_free` (defined below).

## Shared API

```c
void *rpc_data_free (rpc_data* data)
```

Frees the memory allocated for a dynamically allocated rpc_data struct.

# Test

To run your server program, type:

```shell
./rpc-server -p <port> &
./rpc-client -i <ip-address> -p <port>

```

where:

* ip-address is the IPv6 address of the VM on which the server is running.
* port is the TCP (or other transport layer) port number of the server.

The server is expected to listen for incoming connections on the port passed via command line arguments, on any
of the hosts IPv6 network addresses

# Protocol

The protocol is built on TCP, which guarantees reliability. UDP is hard to guarantee reliability despite its speed. Therefore, the UDP version is hard to implement.

1. Find

The client sends find messages to the server to find the handlers:

The first byte of the message is the size of the message.

The second byte of the message is 0, which indicates that this is a find request.

The remaining bytes are the name of the function.

2. Response for find

The server searches the handler list and finds the index for the respective handler:

The first byte of the message is the size of the message.

The second byte of the message is 2, which indicates that this is a handle response.

The third byte of the message is the index of the function.

If the function does not exist, the index -1 is returned, which will be handled by the client properly.

3. Call

The client sends call messages with the payload and index for the functions:

The first byte of the message is the size of the message.

The second byte of the message is 1, which indicates that this is a call request.

The third byte of the message is the size of the size_t.

The fourth byte of the message is the index of the function.

The next **eight** bytes are the data1.

The next sizeof(size_t) bytes are the length of the data2.

The remaining bytes are the data2.

Notice that 8 bytes are used for data1 here for better compatibility.

4. Response for call

The outcome for the call request:

The first byte of the message is the size of the message.

The second byte of the message is the size of the size_t.

The third byte of the message is 3, which indicates that this is a call response.

The next eight bytes of the message is the data1.

The next sizeof(size_t) bytes are the length of the data2.

The remaining bytes are the data2.

If the outcome is NULL, the message is like:

The first byte is the message of the size of the message.

The second byte is 4, which indicates that this is an invalid response that will be handled properly by the client.
